OpenStack Freezer-API
=====================

OpenStack Freezer-api is a RESTFUL API to Store information and metadata about
Backups, Jobs, Clients, Sessions. It helps keeping backup/restore jobs
organized and maintain the status of the backups.

To learn how to use Freezer's API, consult the documentation available online
at:

- `Backup API Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/backup/>`__

For more information on OpenStack APIs, SDKs and CLIs in general, refer to:

- `OpenStack for App Developers <https://www.openstack.org/appdev/>`__
- `Development resources for OpenStack clouds
  <https://developer.openstack.org/>`__

Operators
---------

To learn how to deploy and configure OpenStack Freezer, consult the
documentation available online at:

- `OpenStack Freezer <https://docs.openstack.org/freezer/latest/>`__

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should be reported to
the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained the software from a 3rd party
operating system vendor, it is often wise to use their own bug tracker for
reporting problems. In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

- `Bug Tracker <https://launchpad.net/freezer>`__

Developers
----------

Any new code must follow the development guidelines detailed in the HACKING.rst
file and OpenStack general development guidelines, and pass all unit tests.

Further developer focused documentation is available at:

- `Official Freezer Documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/freezer/latest/>`__
- `Official Client Documentation
  <https://docs.openstack.org/python-freezerclient/latest/>`__
- `Source Code Repository <https://opendev.org/openstack/freezer-api>`__

Other Information
-----------------

During each `Summit`_ and `Project Team Gathering`_, we agree on what the whole
community wants to focus on for the upcoming release. The plans for freezer can
be found at:

- `Freezer Specs <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/freezer-specs/>`__

features:
  - |
    A new module, ``freezer_api.wsgi``, has been added as a place to provide
    WSGI. For example, if using uWSGI then instead of:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        wsgi-file = /bin/freezer-api-wsgi

    You can now use:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        wsgi = freezer_api.wsgi:application

    This also simplifies deployment with other WSGI servers that expect module
    paths such as gunicorn.

upgrade:
  - |
    The WSGI script ``freezer-api-wsgi`` has been removed. Deployment tooling
    should instead reference the Python module path for the wsgi module in
    Freezer, ``freezer_api.wsgi:application`` if their chosen WSGI server
    supports this (gunicorn, uWSGI, etc.) or implement a .wsgi script
    themselves if not (mod_wsgi).
